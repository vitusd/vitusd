- ðŸ‘‹ Hey reader, Iâ€™m @vitusd
I graduated from Uni in December of 2020 with an emphasis in sales and marketing. After experiencing different sales roles I reflected and noticed that through each of these
positions I was natually more drawn to the metrics/KPI/performance aspects. Writing down the time intervals of each cold call I would make to analyze and learn the best time 
of day to call or comparing sales data to upsell or bring on new clients. In October of 2021 I started on my data analyst pathway, learning (still learning) excel, sheets, R,
SQL, and Tableu. 

I'm looking to learn, develop, and become an analyst one day soon!
